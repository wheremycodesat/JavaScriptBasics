# JavaScriptBasics

This repository contains some files to start with JavaScript. As you can see, there is the home.js file where all the code in JavaScript is 
written and a index.html file so you can test the code on a localhost. Furthermore, there is an additional zip with different challenges 
using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, It contains an index.html file, a style.css file and a script.js file and some folders that you will use in the
developtment of the projects. If you want some more information or you want to practice all of these as I did, I highly recommend you 
to take the following course:

It's a full 8 hours JavaScript course, made by Clever Programmer and one cool thing i consider is that this course is made for you to 
practice and follow along.
